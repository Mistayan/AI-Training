# AI TRAINING

Training with psycopg2 and pytactx


## Psycopg2 :
    Is a library developpeded by jusdeliens.
    -> allows us to capture images from a tiny bot.
    -> we need to annalyse the image to calculate Next Move.
    -> control this bot accordingly to the images received.


## Pytactx :
    Python Tactic Matrix abreviation. Developped by jusdeliens.
    This lib allows us to connect to a remote Bot Arena.
    The goal with this one is to elaborate a Bot with pre-defined behaviours, in order to be the last one standing.
